"Inferring allele-specific copy number aberrations and tumor phylogeography from spatially resolved transcriptomics." International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2024. (Cong Ma_Benjamin J. Raphael_allele specific CNV)

*Based on allele information to infer CNV. Use cell-snp to infer BAF and use HMM to infer both read depth ratio (RDR) and b-allele frequency(BAF)*

## Trajectory

*A very interesting angle where adding spatial information to inder trajectory. Find an interesting case where some cells move to different areas (make spatial information useful). The combination of different modality information might also be a reference.*

## Other

*Looks like a very useful tools to combine and analysis multiple spatial data, especially when they were getting from different technologies. It is optimized for efficient usage of memory, mapping different data and so on.*
