"Inferring allele-specific copy number aberrations and tumor phylogeography from spatially resolved transcriptomics." International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2024. (Cong Ma_Benjamin J. Raphael_allele specific CNV)

*Based on allele information to infer CNV. Use cell-snp to infer BAF and use HMM to infer both read depth ratio (RDR) and b-allele frequency(BAF)*

## Trajectory

*A very interesting angle where adding spatial information to inder trajectory. Find an interesting case where some cells move to different areas (make spatial information useful). The combination of different modality information might also be a reference.*

*A very comprehensive and detailed review, of the part related to disease is interesting, not very easy to follow.*

*A review of existing spatial multi-omics technologies and their application to understand tumors. It also contains the introduction of bioinformatics tools to analyze them and potential applications in clinical (decide treatment). The technologies part is its strength.*

*Focusing on mouse models to understand early tumor. It also contains some bioinformatics parts.*

*Looks like a very useful tools to combine and analysis multiple spatial data, especially when they were getting from different technologies. It is optimized for efficient usage of memory, mapping different data and so on.*
